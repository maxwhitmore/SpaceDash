CSC2003S - Game Features

*** SpaceDash ***

After learning that the final game assignment would not be completed, I decided to change my game to something a bit more manageable. I was fascinated by the idea of creating a game with incredibly simple gameplay, but with high re-playability.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Controls:

Left and right arrow keys

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Implemented game features:

1. Creative visual effects (layered, dynamic background of stars)

2. Scoring system

3. Pause/Resume functionality

4. Increased difficulty as time progresses

5. AI - the “AI” in this game is marked by the enemies (circles) moving towards the user (triangle) at any of the 3 possible locations for the user to be. While it is not very advanced, it should suffice in the definition of basic AI

Thank you for your feedback and enjoy!
